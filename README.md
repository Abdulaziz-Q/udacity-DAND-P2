# Project: Investigate a Dataset TMDb movie data

This is the second project with Udacity. In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate findings about it. I use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

### TMDb movie data
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).

### Tech stack:
Tools I used to complete the project:
* [Anaconda] used to manage packages and environments for use with Python.
* [Jupyter] used to data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation and data visualization.

### Main findings:
* The most popular titles
* The length that most of popularity prefer
* Movies has the highest profit
* Movie has the highest profit and the lowest
* The most vote average with most vote count
